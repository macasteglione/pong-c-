# Pong!
This is a C++ version of the classic Pong game, created with Raylib and CMake for the build. Here is a simple illustration I've made while learning C++. I hope you had fun!

## Build
It is a CMake project, so it builds very simply. Open a terminal inside this folder:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run
* On macOS, you get a bundle that you can simply open.
* On Windows/Linux, you get an executable that you can simply run.

## How to play
"W" and "S" are the controls for the first player. The controls for player two are "I" for up and "K" for down. To pause and resume the game, press "P", to quit press "Esc".

## Embedded Project
* [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
